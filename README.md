This is a project for a React JS course on CoderHouse. The idea behind this is to create a functioning e-commerce that feeds information into FireBase. 
Some extensions were added in this project, such as SweetAlert 2, in order to alert the customer when the process of buying the products is terminated and the order is created.
Another extension used was Styled-Component instead of bootstap. This decision was made because throughout the classes all the code was being worked with Styled-Components, and due to lack of times I had to adjust and improvise with this extension. 
A couple of functionalities are missing, such as being able to enter an email when clicking on Sign In or Register. This is also due to lack of times.

This project iscomposed of various folders, such as Components, were all the information required for the logic is held. Styles is also holding all the CSS of the project, each one of them in different pages for easy access. 
The utilities are under the folder "utils". There you can find the Products (this folder is currently not in use, since all the data was sent into FireBase and the project is now pulling data from there), were you'll be able to find all the products with their Ids, categories, prices, etc.

Lastly, the user can feed his Name, last name and email address to the site before finishing his request to buy items. This was intended to be mapped into firebase and grab that information, but wasnâ€™t able to fulfill this in the short spam of delivery due to national Holidays. 
I believe that with an extra couple of days this could have been finalized the way it was supposed to, always intended with academic intends and not for any commercial purposes. 

Hope you enjoy going through this project as much as I have enjoyed working on it.
